For our YouTube Knowledge Miner MVP, we need to implement the urgent authentication bug fixes identified in our testing report. This task is part of Sprint 1 as detailed in docs/sprint_1/sprint1-progress-report.md.

Before implementation, please review:
- docs/sprint_1/Auth Bug Fix Plan.md for the detailed bug fix plan
- docs/sprint_1/Authentication Testing Report 1 Update.md for latest test results
- authentication-test-results.md for specific issues identified
- authentication-testing-plan.md to understand the expected behavior

Focus on fixing these critical issues in order:

1. Anonymous Session Management:
   - Update auth middleware to create anonymous sessions when they don't exist in the database
   - Ensure proper session persistence and retrieval

2. Authentication Middleware:
   - Fix the requireAnyUser middleware to properly handle anonymous sessions
   - Make sure it accepts requests with valid session IDs even without a full user object

3. Session Header Transmission:
   - Correct client-side code to properly include session headers in all API requests
   - Focus specifically on the hooks/use-library-query.ts implementation

4. User ID Consistency:
   - Update video routes to use the correct anonymous user ID (7) instead of hardcoded ID (1)
   - Ensure consistent user identification across the application

Implementation considerations:
- Focus on minimal, targeted changes to fix the immediate issues
- Maintain the existing architecture patterns
- Add appropriate logging to track session creation and validation
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing frontend code

When complete, provide:
- Summary of changes made to each component
- Testing instructions to verify the fixes
- Any database schema changes required
- Explanation of how the anonymous session flow now works end-to-end

Let's focus on getting the anonymous user flow working first, so users can save videos without authentication. Once that's fixed, we'll move on to testing the full registration and migration process.
