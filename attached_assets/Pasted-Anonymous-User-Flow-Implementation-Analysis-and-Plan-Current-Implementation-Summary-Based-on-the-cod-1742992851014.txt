Anonymous User Flow Implementation Analysis and Plan
Current Implementation Summary
Based on the code review, the application currently has functionality for tracking anonymous video usage, but there appears to be an issue with the implementation. The application is trying to:

Store videos analyzed by unauthenticated users in local storage
Count anonymous videos in local storage
Show an authentication prompt when users reach a certain limit
Allow migrating local data to a user account after authentication
However, there seems to be issues with retrieving the anonymous video count and properly handling the flow from anonymous to authenticated state.

Implementation Plan for Anonymous Video Analysis
Here's a comprehensive plan to implement the requirement of allowing users to analyze up to 3 videos before being prompted to login:

1. Local Storage Functionality
Ensure proper local storage functions for getting/setting anonymous video data
Implement a function to count videos in local storage
Set a maximum limit of 3 videos
2. Auth Prompt Dialog Enhancement
Update the auth-prompt-dialog to accurately check and display anonymous video count
Only show the prompt after a user attempts to analyze a 4th video
Provide clear messaging about the 3-video limit
3. Video Input Component Update
Modify the video input form to check anonymous video count before processing
Display appropriate messages when limit is reached
Handle the transition to auth prompt when needed
4. Navbar Component Enhancement
Update the navbar to display the current video count (e.g., "2/3 videos")
Provide visual indication when approaching the limit
5. Data Migration Flow
Ensure smooth migration of local videos to database when user authenticates
Implement conflict resolution for duplicate videos
Below is a concrete implementation plan:

Summary of Changes
Storage Management: Added video count tracking in localStorage
Authentication Dialog: Updated to show different messages based on whether users have reached the limit
Video Input: Modified to check the 3-video limit before prompting for login
Library Component: Updated to load local videos for anonymous users and only show auth prompt after limit
Navbar: Added a video counter to show anonymous users their current usage (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
This implementation will:

Allow anonymous users to analyze and save up to 3 videos in their local library
Only enforce login after they've reached the limit
Provide visual feedback on how many videos they've used
Still offer strategic, non-blocking prompts to create an account occasionally
