# YouTube Buddy App - Phase 2: Library Management & Organization

## Project Overview
Building on Phase 1 of the YouTube Buddy app, I now need to implement comprehensive library management features and content organization capabilities.

## Phase 2 Technical Requirements
- Enhance the existing React frontend
- Expand Supabase schema for content organization
- Implement filtering, sorting, and search functionality

## Phase 2 Features to Implement

### 1. Video Library Views
- Implement dual-view video library:
  - Grid/Tile view with thumbnails (default)
  - List view as an alternative
- Create view toggle controls
- Ensure both views display key video metadata
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes

### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
- Create comprehensive search functionality:
  - Full-text search across video titles, descriptions, and transcripts
  - Category-based filtering
  - Rating-based filtering (1-5 stars)
  - Date range filtering
- Implement combined filters (e.g., category + rating)
- Add sorting options (alphabetical, date, rating)
- Create "saved searches" functionality

### 3. Video Collection Organization
- Implement playlist/collection feature:
  - Create named collections of videos
  - Add/remove videos from collections
  - Display collection membership on video cards
- Enable bulk operations on videos:
  - Multi-select videos for batch categorization
  - Bulk delete with confirmation
  - Bulk add to collections
- Implement drag-and-drop organization (optional)

### 4. Video Management
- Create comprehensive video edit capabilities:
  - Update notes/comments
  - Change category or collection assignments
  - Modify ratings
  - Add timestamps or highlights
- Implement video deletion with recovery option
- Add favorite/bookmark functionality

## Data Model Enhancements
- Collections table
- Collection_Videos junction table
- Saved_Searches table
- Enhanced indexing for search functionality

Please provide a detailed implementation plan for these library management features, including component structure, state management approach, and database design considerations.
