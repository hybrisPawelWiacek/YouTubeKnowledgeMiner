Task: Implement a robust, production-ready logging system with initial focus on authentication flows

Context:
We're implementing authentication features and currently fixing bugs. Before proceeding to the next phase (Strategic Authentication Prompts), we need to establish a mature logging system to help debug authentication issues, monitor application health, and provide visibility into user journeys. This logging system should follow industry best practices and be consistent across the entire application.

Requirements:
1. Core Logging Infrastructure:
   - Implement standardized logging service/utility
   - Define appropriate log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
   - Ensure consistent log format with essential context
   - Configure log destinations (console, file, etc.)
   - Implement log redaction for sensitive data (tokens, passwords)

2. Authentication-specific Logging:
   - Log all authentication attempts (success and failure)
   - Track user session creation, validation, and expiration
   - Record transitions between anonymous and authenticated states
   - Log authentication errors with appropriate context
   - Track demo user authentication events

3. API and Request Logging:
   - Log API requests and responses (with sensitive data redacted)
   - Include request IDs for correlation
   - Track response times
   - Record error responses with context

4. Application State Logging:
   - Log critical state changes (user status, permissions)
   - Record feature access attempts and authorization decisions
   - Track resource usage (especially for anonymous user limits)

5. Error and Exception Handling:
   - Create consistent error logging pattern
   - Include stack traces for exceptions
   - Categorize errors appropriately
   - Ensure uncaught exceptions are properly logged

Deliverables:
1. Logging utility/service implementation
2. Configuration for different environments (development, production)
3. Integration with authentication components
4. Implementation guidelines for future logging usage
5. Examples of how to use logging in different scenarios

Implementation Approach:
1. First, create a centralized logging service/utility
2. Define standard log formats and context requirements
3. Implement in authentication-related components first
4. Add logging to API layer and request handling
5. Create guidelines for logging in future development

Success Criteria:
- Logging provides clear visibility into authentication flows
- Error conditions are logged with sufficient context for debugging
- Authentication events are comprehensively tracked
- Sensitive information is properly redacted
- Logging format is consistent and well-structured
- System is extensible for future application areas
