# YouTube Buddy App - Phase 4: Semantic Search with RAG Implementation

## Project Overview
Building on the previous phases of the YouTube Buddy app, I now need to implement advanced semantic search capabilities using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) across all stored video content. This will enable users to search deeply within video transcripts and find relevant content based on meaning rather than just keywords.

## Phase 4 Technical Requirements
- Vector database integration with Supabase (pgvector extension)
- Text embedding generation for video transcripts and summaries
- Implementation of semantic search capabilities
- RAG implementation for contextually enhanced responses
- Performance optimization for large content collections

## Phase 4 Features to Implement

### 1. Vector Database Setup
- Configure pgvector extension in Supabase
- Create vector embeddings table for storing transcript chunks
- Implement backend functionality to generate and store embeddings
- Setup batch processing for existing video content
- Create webhook/trigger for processing new video additions

### 2. Text Embedding Generation
- Integrate with embedding model API (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002)
- Implement transcript chunking strategy (optimal size for search)
- Process and store embeddings for:
  - Full video transcripts (chunked appropriately)
  - Summary bullet points
  - User-added notes and comments
- Create metadata linkage between vector embeddings and source content

### 3. Semantic Search Implementation
- Develop advanced search interface with:
  - Natural language query input
  - Filters for content type (transcript, summary, notes)
  - Source video filtering options
- Implement backend vector similarity search
- Create relevance scoring and ranking system
- Design result highlighting to show context around matches
- Support search across all videos or within specific collections

### 4. RAG-Enhanced Responses
- Implement retrieval system to fetch relevant transcript sections based on user queries
- Create context assembly mechanism for feeding into generative AI
- Develop prompt engineering to generate contextually accurate responses
- Implement citation system to reference source videos and timestamps
- Create user feedback loop for response quality improvement

### 5. Performance & UX Optimization
- Implement caching for frequent searches
- Create pagination or infinite scroll for search results
- Add search suggestions based on content analysis
- Implement debounced search for type-ahead functionality
- Design clear visualization of search matches within video content

## Data Model Enhancements
- Embeddings table with vector fields
- Search_History table for user queries
- Enhanced indexing for performance optimization
- Caching infrastructure for frequent queries

## Implementation Considerations
- Balance embedding granularity vs storage requirements
- Optimize for performance with potentially large video libraries
- Ensure privacy controls for user-specific content
- Consider rate limiting and cost management for embedding generation
- Implement fallback search for edge cases

Please provide a detailed implementation plan for this semantic search with RAG capability, including architecture design, embedding strategy, vector search implementation, and user interface considerations. Focus particularly on the integration between the vector search and the generative AI components to create a seamless user experience.
