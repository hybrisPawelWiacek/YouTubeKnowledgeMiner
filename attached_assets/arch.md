## Anonymous Session Architecture

The application implements a robust session-based approach for anonymous users:

- **Server-Side Sessions:** Unlike traditional client-side anonymous user tracking, all anonymous user state is managed on the server
- **Database-Backed Storage:** Anonymous sessions are stored in the database with the following key attributes:
  - Unique session ID (format: `anon_[timestamp]_[random]`)
  - Creation timestamp
  - Last active timestamp (updated on every interaction)
  - Video count (for enforcing the 3-video limit)
  - Optional metadata (user agent, IP address)

- **Database Schema:**
  - Dedicated `anonymous_sessions` table in PostgreSQL with fields:
    - `id`: Serial primary key
    - `session_id`: Unique text identifier (format: `anon_[timestamp]_[random]`)
    - `created_at`: Timestamp when session was created
    - `last_active_at`: Timestamp updated on every interaction
    - `video_count`: Integer tracking number of videos saved (for limit enforcement)
    - `user_agent`: Optional user agent string
    - `ip_address`: Optional IP address

- **Database Integration:**
  - Anonymous videos are associated with user_id=7 (dedicated anonymous user) and a unique anonymous_session_id
  - User identification is primarily done via anonymous_session_id for unregistered users
  - Special handling in database queries to filter by session ID rather than user ID
  - Session cleanup mechanism removes inactive sessions after a configurable time period

- **Frontend-Backend Communication:**
  - Session ID stored in browser's localStorage using key `ytk_anonymous_session_id`
  - Session ID included in all API requests via the `x-anonymous-session` custom header
  - Backend validates session existence and freshness with every request
  - Automatic session creation for new users without existing sessions via `getOrCreateAnonymousSessionId()` function

- **Authentication Middleware:**
  - `getUserInfo` middleware extracts both authenticated and anonymous user information
  - `requireSession` middleware enforces valid session existence (anonymous or authenticated)
  - `requireAuth` middleware restricts certain routes to authenticated users only
  - All routes supporting anonymous users include `requireSession` middleware

- **Frontend Implementation:**
  - Client-side session management in `anonymous-session.ts`:
    - `generateSessionId()`: Creates unique session IDs
    - `getOrCreateAnonymousSessionId()`: Returns existing ID or generates new one
    - `hasAnonymousSession()`: Checks if session exists in localStorage
    - `getAnonymousVideoCountInfo()`: Fetches count of videos from server
    - `hasReachedAnonymousLimit()`: Checks if user has reached 3-video limit

- **API Integration:**
  - `apiRequest()` function automatically attaches anonymous session headers
  - All client-side data fetching uses `apiRequest` to maintain session consistency
  - Specialized endpoints for anonymous functionality:
    - `/api/anonymous/videos/count`: Returns current video count and limit
    - `/api/auth/migrate`: Migrates videos when anonymous user creates account

- **Entitlements Management:**
  - Strict enforcement of 3-video limit per anonymous session
  - Video count incremented with each successful video save
  - Count checked before allowing new video processing
  - Strategic prompts when limit is reached to encourage account creation

- **Error Handling:**
  - Consistent error format for both anonymous and authenticated users
  - Special error code `SESSION_REQUIRED` for missing/invalid sessions
  - Special error code `ANONYMOUS_LIMIT_REACHED` when video limit is reached
  - Clear, user-friendly error messages explaining limits and encouraging signup

- **Migration Path:**
  - When an anonymous user creates an account, their videos can be transferred to their new user account
  - Content migration preserves all metadata and associated data (embeddings, etc.)
  - Session cleanup after successful migration

- **Type Safety:**
  - Schema definition for anonymous sessions in shared schema
  - Strong typing for all session-related operations
  - Support for nullable user_id in application logic with runtime safety

## Conclusion

This application represents a sophisticated modern web architecture using TypeScript throughout the stack. It leverages AI capabilities for natural language processing and semantic search, with a hybrid database approach that uses Neon PostgreSQL with pgvector for primary storage and vector operations. The dual-mode authentication system provides flexibility, allowing the application to function with or without Supabase integration while maintaining a smooth user experience.
