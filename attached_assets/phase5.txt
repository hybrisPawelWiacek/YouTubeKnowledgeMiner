# YouTube Buddy App - Phase 5: Authentication Enhancement & User Onboarding

## Project Overview
For this phase of the YouTube Buddy app, I need to enhance the authentication system by adding Google login support and implement an intuitive user onboarding flow that prompts for account creation at strategic moments.

## Phase 5 Technical Requirements
- Google OAuth integration
- Enhanced Supabase authentication configuration
- Strategic account creation prompts
- User session management
- Seamless transition between anonymous and authenticated states

## Phase 5 Features to Implement

### 1. Google Authentication Integration
- Implement Google OAuth provider with Supabase Auth
- Create secure configuration for Google API credentials
- Design login button with Google branding guidelines
- Implement user profile retrieval from Google account
- Handle authentication state across the application
- Create account linking if email already exists in system
- Store additional Google-provided user metadata (profile picture, name)

### 2. Strategic Account Creation Prompts
- Implement detection for unauthenticated users
- Create modal prompts for account creation at key moments:
  - When attempting to save a video after analysis
  - When trying to analyze a second video
  - When trying to access the video library
- Design non-intrusive prompt UI with clear value proposition
- Provide option to continue as guest or create account
- Implement "remind me later" option that suppresses prompts temporarily

### 3. Anonymous-to-Authenticated Transition
- Implement temporary local storage for unauthenticated user actions
- Create seamless migration of temporary data to user account upon signup
- Handle edge cases (e.g., conflicts with existing saved content)
- Provide feedback during data migration process
- Ensure no data loss during transition

### 4. Authentication UX Enhancements
- Create persistent login state with secure token storage
- Implement intuitive login/logout UX in navigation
- Add user profile dropdown with account management options
- Design clear authentication error messages
- Create "magic link" email alternative for non-Google users
- Implement account deletion functionality with data cleanup

### 5. User Preference Management
- Create settings for authentication preferences
- Add options for session duration
- Implement privacy controls for user data
- Create account linking options for existing users
- Add email notification preferences for account activity

## UI/UX Considerations
- Design unobtrusive but compelling account creation prompts
- Create seamless visual transition when authenticating
- Implement skeleton screens during authentication processes
- Design responsive login components for all device sizes
- Create micro-interactions for authentication flows

## Implementation Considerations
- Ensure GDPR/privacy compliance for authentication data
- Implement proper security measures for tokens and credentials
- Create comprehensive error handling for auth failures
- Add logging for authentication issues
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing users

Please provide a detailed implementation plan for these authentication enhancements, focusing on creating a frictionless experience that encourages account creation without disrupting the core user experience. Include mockups for the account creation prompts and the Google authentication flow.
