API within</text><text start="3.639" dur="4.361">nadn to understand any of the documents</text><text start="5.92" dur="3.92">you may have so here is the mystal OCR</text><text start="8" dur="3.639">homepage introducing the world&amp;#39;s best</text><text start="9.84" dur="2.959">document understanding API we&amp;#39;re not</text><text start="11.639" dur="2.241">going to spend too much time here I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="12.799" dur="2.521">link this in the description if you want</text><text start="13.88" dur="2.6">to take a look but I just wanted to show</text><text start="15.32" dur="2.879">you some of these really impressive</text><text start="16.48" dur="3.08">results of on the left we have the</text><text start="18.199" dur="3.881">tables and figures and then on the right</text><text start="19.56" dur="3.92">we have the actual OCR result same thing</text><text start="22.08" dur="2.76">with um math as you can see we have</text><text start="23.48" dur="2.44">these different equations and then</text><text start="24.84" dur="4.12">they&amp;#39;re coming through very clear with</text><text start="25.92" dur="4.92">this OCR we also have um Hindi so</text><text start="28.96" dur="3.52">different languages are able to to be</text><text start="30.84" dur="3.36">you know recognized as well and and</text><text start="32.48" dur="3.12">translated over and then something like</text><text start="34.2" dur="3.32">scan documents if you have scanned</text><text start="35.6" dur="3.4">invoices or pictures of textbooks as you</text><text start="37.52" dur="3.48">can see we&amp;#39;re getting that all back</text><text start="39" dur="3.44">pretty clearly over here so this is</text><text start="41" dur="3.36">really cool and we&amp;#39;re able to get in</text><text start="42.44" dur="4.119">here and connect it into nadn and play</text><text start="44.36" dur="3.92">around with it for free so let&amp;#39;s dive</text><text start="46.559" dur="3.121">into how you actually set that up okay</text><text start="48.28" dur="3.48">so real quick demo before we get into</text><text start="49.68" dur="3.879">the step-by-step tutorial also this</text><text start="51.76" dur="3.119">template is available in the free school</text><text start="53.559" dur="3.241">Community if you want to download that</text><text start="54.879" dur="3.121">to follow along with this video but</text><text start="56.8" dur="2.32">what&amp;#39;s going on here is we have three</text><text start="58" dur="2.64">steps and I&amp;#39;m going to walk through what</text><text start="59.12" dur="3.36">they do but but we have a form</text><text start="60.64" dur="3.36">submission so if I hit test workflow we</text><text start="62.48" dur="3.039">have this form pop up I&amp;#39;m going to drop</text><text start="64" dur="3.36">in a document now that we&amp;#39;ve uploaded</text><text start="65.519" dur="3.561">our invoice I&amp;#39;ll hit submit and we will</text><text start="67.36" dur="3.52">watch it run through these three steps</text><text start="69.08" dur="3.679">that quick it&amp;#39;s already done it uploaded</text><text start="70.88" dur="3.76">to mistel we got the URL back and then</text><text start="72.759" dur="3.921">we got our OCR results which are now</text><text start="74.64" dur="4.119">coming through and as we can see we have</text><text start="76.68" dur="3.759">all of this markdown which is everything</text><text start="78.759" dur="3.121">that&amp;#39;s in the document even if it looks</text><text start="80.439" dur="3.521">a little weird we have all this</text><text start="81.88" dur="3.76">information back and I I validated it it</text><text start="83.96" dur="3.64">is accurate the only mistake was that</text><text start="85.64" dur="4.36">instead of saying forwarding agent it</text><text start="87.6" dur="4.199">said form marting agent so it messed up</text><text start="90" dur="3.479">the W and the M but all the numbers are</text><text start="91.799" dur="3.401">accurate here so let&amp;#39;s get into the</text><text start="93.479" dur="3.28">breakdown of setting up each of these</text><text start="95.2" dur="3.48">requests so the first thing that we want</text><text start="96.759" dur="3.921">to do is go to this website so that we</text><text start="98.68" dur="4.079">can actually try the API for free you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="100.68" dur="3.64">click up here try the API and this will</text><text start="102.759" dur="3.801">prompt you to create an account you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="104.32" dur="4.32">log in and then once you get in here</text><text start="106.56" dur="3.559">before we can actually get our API key</text><text start="108.64" dur="2.92">we need to have some sort of</text><text start="110.119" dur="3.081">subscription plan you don&amp;#39;t have to put</text><text start="111.56" dur="3.199">in any billing information it&amp;#39;ll just</text><text start="113.2" dur="3.16">ask you to verify your phone number and</text><text start="114.759" dur="3.481">you can click on the experiment plan</text><text start="116.36" dur="4.039">which will be free and then from there</text><text start="118.24" dur="4.28">we&amp;#39;ll come into here API key and we will</text><text start="120.399" dur="3.441">want to grab a new key so I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="122.52" dur="3.44">create a new one for the sake of this</text><text start="123.84" dur="4.24">demo we&amp;#39;re going to call this one demo</text><text start="125.96" dur="4.12">to because I did a demo earlier today</text><text start="128.08" dur="3.36">and I&amp;#39;m going to click create new key</text><text start="130.08" dur="3.44">and then it&amp;#39;s going to give you an API</text><text start="131.44" dur="3.92">key obviously to copy and store that</text><text start="133.52" dur="3.799">somewhere because you won&amp;#39;t be able to</text><text start="135.36" dur="3.159">grab it again so now that we have that</text><text start="137.319" dur="3.081">key created we&amp;#39;re just going to come up</text><text start="138.519" dur="3.321">to the top right and click on docs which</text><text start="140.4" dur="2.839">is going to take us to the documentation</text><text start="141.84" dur="3.6">of the different ways that we can use</text><text start="143.239" dur="3.521">mistal AI so on the left hand side we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="145.44" dur="3.24">looking for capabilities and we&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="146.76" dur="4.16">to click on OCR and document</text><text start="148.68" dur="3.32">understanding now we see here are we</text><text start="150.92" dur="2.48">have a bunch of different end points</text><text start="152" dur="4.48">that we can hit and different</text><text start="153.4" dur="5.8">functionality within this OCR like you</text><text start="156.48" dur="5.08">know document OCR processor OCR with PDF</text><text start="159.2" dur="4.759">uploaded PDF with image all this other</text><text start="161.56" dur="3.679">stuff and so what we have to do today is</text><text start="163.959" dur="2.761">kind of a three-step approach where</text><text start="165.239" dur="4.961">we&amp;#39;re going to be getting a binary file</text><text start="166.72" dur="5.32">into NN we have to upload it to mistl we</text><text start="170.2" dur="4.44">have to pull back a URL from mistl and</text><text start="172.04" dur="4.6">then we feed that URL into the OCR to</text><text start="174.64" dur="3.12">actually get our text result back so it</text><text start="176.64" dur="2.64">may seem a little confusing but we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="177.76" dur="3.28">going to walk through it step by step</text><text start="179.28" dur="4.2">it&amp;#39;s not too bad at all but real quick</text><text start="181.04" dur="4.52">before we set up this OCR let&amp;#39;s talk</text><text start="183.48" dur="3.839">about why we actually need this so</text><text start="185.56" dur="3.64">looking at NN real quick let&amp;#39;s set up a</text><text start="187.319" dur="3.601">form trigger and there&amp;#39;s multiple ways</text><text start="189.2" dur="3.44">that you could get your binary data into</text><text start="190.92" dur="3.319">Ed end for the sake of the video we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="192.64" dur="2.959">just going to set up a quick form where</text><text start="194.239" dur="4.801">we&amp;#39;re just going to be calling this you</text><text start="195.599" dur="6.441">know invoice processing please upload</text><text start="199.04" dur="5.6">your invoice and then we just want one</text><text start="202.04" dur="4.839">file drop we&amp;#39;re going to have a required</text><text start="204.64" dur="4.2">field we&amp;#39;re going to have just one file</text><text start="206.879" dur="3.72">allowed and it&amp;#39;s just going to be called</text><text start="208.84" dur="3.64">invoice and so all this is doing here is</text><text start="210.599" dur="4.041">we just set up a really quick interface</text><text start="212.48" dur="3.479">where when we click test step this is</text><text start="214.64" dur="2.92">what gets pulled up and this is where</text><text start="215.959" dur="4.121">the user will click on choose file and</text><text start="217.56" dur="4.52">drop in a PDF so right here I just</text><text start="220.08" dur="3.48">dropped in a fake PDF this is what it</text><text start="222.08" dur="3.04">looks like it&amp;#39;s just kind of a a really</text><text start="223.56" dur="3">simple template and it has different</text><text start="225.12" dur="4.6">information like you know the tracking</text><text start="226.56" dur="5.08">number invoice number um the cost all</text><text start="229.72" dur="5.04">that kind of stuff and so because I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="231.64" dur="5.319">going to submit this we will get that</text><text start="234.76" dur="4.039">binary data now within our NN as you can</text><text start="236.959" dur="3.64">see this is the PDF that we were just</text><text start="238.799" dur="3.601">looking at and I just want to highlight</text><text start="240.599" dur="3.48">real quick the typical way that we would</text><text start="242.4" dur="3.52">try to extract text from here is we</text><text start="244.079" dur="4.321">would type an extract we would grab an</text><text start="245.92" dur="5.239">extract from PDF and we would be looking</text><text start="248.4" dur="4.679">to extract from a certain field which is</text><text start="251.159" dur="3.561">a binary field and by default that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="253.079" dur="3.081">going to be data we don&amp;#39;t have a field</text><text start="254.72" dur="3.28">over here called Data so if I hit test</text><text start="256.16" dur="4.359">step it would give us an error there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="258" dur="4.16">no binary field called Data so this is</text><text start="260.519" dur="3.801">the actual name of the binary field over</text><text start="262.16" dur="3.92">here invoice so I&amp;#39;m going to copy that</text><text start="264.32" dur="4.4">paste it into there and now we should be</text><text start="266.08" dur="4.119">able to extract text however we can see</text><text start="268.72" dur="3.56">that the text that we actually extracted</text><text start="270.199" dur="4.681">is not accurate so all we&amp;#39;re actually</text><text start="272.28" dur="4.12">pulling back are sort of the field names</text><text start="274.88" dur="3.56">so we&amp;#39;re looking at forwarding agent</text><text start="276.4" dur="4.239">date invoice number tracking number paid</text><text start="278.44" dur="3.92">by order ID but if we actually go to the</text><text start="280.639" dur="3.521">document we&amp;#39;re not getting any of the</text><text start="282.36" dur="3.72">actual values back we&amp;#39;re just getting</text><text start="284.16" dur="4">sort of these headers so this is a good</text><text start="286.08" dur="4.16">example of when just extracting straight</text><text start="288.16" dur="3.64">away from a PDF file is not going to</text><text start="290.24" dur="2.88">work okay so what we&amp;#39;re going to do is</text><text start="291.8" dur="2.92">drag this down here delete that</text><text start="293.12" dur="4.88">connection and we are going to set up an</text><text start="294.72" dur="5.08">HTTP request to actually hit mistol so</text><text start="298" dur="4.24">before we configure that at all let&amp;#39;s go</text><text start="299.8" dur="4.239">back into the documentation from mistl</text><text start="302.24" dur="3">and explain what&amp;#39;s going on here so the</text><text start="304.039" dur="2.841">first thing you want to do is I think</text><text start="305.24" dur="3.48">when you open this up by default it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="306.88" dur="3.24">going to be on python just switch this</text><text start="308.72" dur="3.039">over to curl all we want to look at is</text><text start="310.12" dur="5.16">curl because we&amp;#39;re able to copy these</text><text start="311.759" dur="5.121">curl commands and the HTTP request will</text><text start="315.28" dur="4.12">basically be populated for us which is</text><text start="316.88" dur="5.039">great so first thing that we need to do</text><text start="319.4" dur="5.239">is actually upload our binary file from</text><text start="321.919" dur="4.601">NN to mistl and so all we have to do</text><text start="324.639" dur="3.28">here is just take it step by step we</text><text start="326.52" dur="3.399">have this endpoint which is upload a</text><text start="327.919" dur="3.4">file or sorry a function and so we just</text><text start="329.919" dur="3.56">have this curl command you&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="331.319" dur="5.361">hit copy which is right here go back</text><text start="333.479" dur="5.241">into nadn open up your HTTP request hit</text><text start="336.68" dur="3.799">import curl and we can paste that curl</text><text start="338.72" dur="3.12">command and then hit import and what</text><text start="340.479" dur="3.481">this is going to do is it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="341.84" dur="3.6">automatically populate this request for</text><text start="343.96" dur="4.2">us which is great it fills out the</text><text start="345.44" dur="4.8">method the URL the authorization all we</text><text start="348.16" dur="3.44">have to do now is drop our API key and</text><text start="350.24" dur="4.239">then configure what actually are we</text><text start="351.6" dur="4.48">sending over so right here we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="354.479" dur="4.16">basically telling mistl that we are</text><text start="356.08" dur="4.64">sending over um this information for the</text><text start="358.639" dur="4.081">purpose of OCR and then we have to</text><text start="360.72" dur="4.919">explain what actual file are we sending</text><text start="362.72" dur="5.44">over so we&amp;#39;re using end binary file the</text><text start="365.639" dur="5.68">file name is or sorry the name of this</text><text start="368.16" dur="4.759">value is file and then we&amp;#39;re saying okay</text><text start="371.319" dur="2.88">what&amp;#39;s the actual file we&amp;#39;re looking at</text><text start="372.919" dur="4.84">and it&amp;#39;s going to look for a binary</text><text start="374.199" dur="5.961">field once again so like we just saw up</text><text start="377.759" dur="3.961">here we couldn&amp;#39;t put this in as data we</text><text start="380.16" dur="4.039">had to put this in as the binary field</text><text start="381.72" dur="4.479">from the left hand side of the input so</text><text start="384.199" dur="3.601">I&amp;#39;m just going to copy that into there</text><text start="386.199" dur="3.521">and now all we have left to do is set up</text><text start="387.8" dur="4.48">our actual authorization so this is</text><text start="389.72" dur="4.4">where you would drop in your API key the</text><text start="392.28" dur="4.68">name has to be authorization the value</text><text start="394.12" dur="5.32">has to be Bearer space and then we put</text><text start="396.96" dur="4.16">in our API key which I have copied and</text><text start="399.44" dur="3.039">it is right here so this is how you</text><text start="401.12" dur="2.799">typically do it but one thing I want to</text><text start="402.479" dur="4.041">show you guys is because this is a</text><text start="403.919" dur="4.081">header parameter header authorization we</text><text start="406.52" dur="3.2">don&amp;#39;t want to do it like this so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="408" dur="3.599">just going to copy this real quick and</text><text start="409.72" dur="3.84">we are going to add a predefined</text><text start="411.599" dur="3.121">authentication so that we can save it</text><text start="413.56" dur="4.319">because if you remember I said we have</text><text start="414.72" dur="4.52">to do three different a HTTP requests if</text><text start="417.879" dur="3.201">we save our credential we don&amp;#39;t have to</text><text start="419.24" dur="4.04">do each time so I&amp;#39;m going to come down</text><text start="421.08" dur="3.72">here and do generic credential type we</text><text start="423.28" dur="3.44">know because we see right here that this</text><text start="424.8" dur="3.839">is a header off we can click on header</text><text start="426.72" dur="2.96">off and then we just have to set one up</text><text start="428.639" dur="3.161">and as you can see I already have my</text><text start="429.68" dur="3.639">mistal OCR credentials set up but I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="431.8" dur="3.079">going to walk through creating a new one</text><text start="433.319" dur="4.961">so this we&amp;#39;re just going to call it</text><text start="434.879" dur="5">mistal OCR demo and then you can save</text><text start="438.28" dur="4.039">all of your credentials as you saw I had</text><text start="439.879" dur="4.16">different ones for like Twitter tavali</text><text start="442.319" dur="3.201">um 11 Labs I have all my credentials</text><text start="444.039" dur="3.84">saved so I don&amp;#39;t have to go get them</text><text start="445.52" dur="5">again later so we know that we have to</text><text start="447.879" dur="3.76">make the title here author authorization</text><text start="450.52" dur="3.04">and then for the value I&amp;#39;m going to make</text><text start="451.639" dur="3.161">it an expression so we can actually see</text><text start="453.56" dur="2.479">if you have it fixed it&amp;#39;s just going to</text><text start="454.8" dur="2.48">come up like this so you won&amp;#39;t be able</text><text start="456.039" dur="4">to see it and so what we want to put in</text><text start="457.28" dur="4.88">is Bearer space r API key and make sure</text><text start="460.039" dur="4.481">there&amp;#39;s a space there we&amp;#39;ll hit save we</text><text start="462.16" dur="5.319">should be connected successfully and now</text><text start="464.52" dur="4.28">we have our header off already saved so</text><text start="467.479" dur="3.28">we can turn off the send headers we</text><text start="468.8" dur="5.079">don&amp;#39;t need to send that over again and</text><text start="470.759" dur="6.601">now let&amp;#39;s just rename this node upload</text><text start="473.879" dur="4.961">to mistal so we will hit test step and</text><text start="477.36" dur="3.32">we should be good to go one thing to</text><text start="478.84" dur="3.88">keep in mind here is if you just created</text><text start="480.68" dur="4.479">your mistel account and you just got</text><text start="482.72" dur="4">your API key it may error because it may</text><text start="485.159" dur="3.521">take like 5 to 10 minutes to warm up so</text><text start="486.72" dur="3.64">if you&amp;#39;re seeing that that&amp;#39;s why don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="488.68" dur="3.56">worry you probably set this up correctly</text><text

case we</text><text start="513.32" dur="3">refresh by accident and we don&amp;#39;t want to</text><text start="514.68" dur="2.919">have to make another request we&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="516.32" dur="3.959">to hit the plus we&amp;#39;re going to do</text><text start="517.599" dur="5.12">another HTTP request and now we&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="520.279" dur="4.921">to go back to the documentation to see</text><text start="522.719" dur="4.281">how we actually set up this request so</text><text start="525.2" dur="3.4">you can see here we have this is the one</text><text start="527" dur="3.56">we&amp;#39;re looking for the function is called</text><text start="528.6" dur="5.04">get signed URL and this is going to</text><text start="530.56" dur="4.36">return a URL that we can access the PDF</text><text start="533.64" dur="2.759">so we&amp;#39;ll see what this looks like but</text><text start="534.92" dur="4.84">all we have to do real quick is hit the</text><text start="536.399" dur="5.88">copy curl command go back into naden hit</text><text start="539.76" dur="4.48">import curl paste in the new curl and</text><text start="542.279" dur="4.321">hit import so as you can see now it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="544.24" dur="5.839">been populated our method is get the URL</text><text start="546.6" dur="5.72">endpoint is populated we

start="553.519" dur="3.121">headers completely because we don&amp;#39;t need</text><text start="555" dur="2.76">it we already know that we&amp;#39;ve set up our</text><text start="556.64" dur="3.879">credential so we&amp;#39;re just going to come</text><text start="557.76" dur="4.28">in here grab credential or grab generic</text><text start="560.519" dur="5">grab header and then we can just grab</text><text start="562.04" dur="5.64">our mistal OCR demo that we just set up</text><text start="565.519" dur="4.081">and all we have to change here is within</text><text start="567.68" dur="4.36">the actual URL as you can see it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="569.6" dur="4.479">looking for an ID so we need to change</text><text start="572.04" dur="4.359">this to an expression and then after the</text><text start="574.079" dur="4.641">files and the URL between the two</text><text start="576.399" dur="4">slashes get rid of ID and we&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="578.72"

every</text><text start="585" dur="4.2">time someone drops a new form this is</text><text start="587.6" dur="3.239">going to be pulling the ID that actually</text><text start="589.2" dur="5.319">came through so now I&amp;#39;m just going to</text><text start="590.839" dur="5.281">change this to get signed URL rename</text><text start="594.519" dur="3.521">that node so we know what&amp;#39;s going on and</text><text start="596.12" dur="4.12">hit test step and now we&amp;#39;re getting an</text><text start="598.04" dur="4.2">actual URL pulled back which we can copy</text><text start="600.24" dur="3.96">into our browser and we will see that</text><text start="602.24" dur="3.719">this is in fact or sorry it just</text><text start="604.2" dur="3.68">downloads the the file but this is in</text><text start="605.959" dur="4.921">fact the invoice that we were just</text><text start="607.88" dur="5.6">looking at so perfect these two steps</text><text start="610.88" dur="4.48">are working let&amp;#39;s pin this data and now</text><text start="613.48" dur="4.96">let&amp;#39;s set up a another step which is</text><text start="615.36" dur="5.28">going to be um actually getting the OCR</text><text start="618.44" dur="4.68">results back so it&amp;#39;s going to be our</text><text start="620.64" dur="5.199">third and final HTTP request and what</text><text start="623.12" dur="5.56">we&amp;#39;re going to do here is come into M&amp;#39;s</text><text start="625.839" dur="7.281">OCR API documentation and this time what</text><text start="628.68" dur="6.719">we&amp;#39;re doing is is we are doing OCR with</text><text start="633.12" dur="4.44">PDF because as you can see what we fill</text><text start="635.399" dur="3.961">in here is a URL of the document so now</text><text start="637.56" dur="4.719">that we have that we can copy this curl</text><text start="639.36" dur="6.08">command we can come into here hit import</text><text start="642.279" dur="5.481">curl and paste that in and we should now</text><text start="645.44" dur="3.92">see that we have the actual body filled</text><text start="647.76" dur="3.28">out so first thing we&amp;#39;re going to do</text><text start="649.36" dur="3.479">before we set anything up turn off our</text><text start="651.04" dur="3.72">headers and just grab our credential</text><text start="652.839" dur="3.081">that we had already set up I think that</text><text start="654.76" dur="2.48">this is the best way to do it cuz it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="655.92" dur="3.4">always going to be Sav but if you think</text><text start="657.24" dur="3.76">it&amp;#39;s a hassle don&amp;#39;t worry about it but</text><text start="659.32" dur="3.959">now we have our credential and now all</text><text start="661" dur="4.32">we have to do down here is we have um</text><text start="663.279" dur="3.161">the Json body that we&amp;#39;re sending over so</text><text start="665.32" dur="3.36">let me change this to an expression and</text><text start="666.44" dur="3.6">make this full screen so what we see is</text><text start="668.68" dur="3.68">that we have the model that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="670.04" dur="4.88">hitting is mystal OCR latest the</text><text start="672.36" dur="4.039">document is going to be um document URL</text><text start="674.92" dur="3.24">that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re feeding in and then we</text><text start="676.399" dur="4.88">actually have to give it the document</text><text start="678.16" dur="4.96">URL so instead of this example URL we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="681.279" dur="3.401">going to delete that and we&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="683.12" dur="3.519">going to drag in the URL from the left</text><text start="684.68" dur="3.76">hand side right in between those two</text><text start="686.639" dur="4.161">quotation marks and on the right you can</text><text start="688.44" dur="4.6">see we&amp;#39;re getting that f URL back and</text><text start="690.8" dur="5.24">now we should be good to hit test step</text><text start="693.04" dur="4.919">and we should get a output and what</text><text start="696.04" dur="4.52">we&amp;#39;re now getting as you can see is a</text><text start="697.959" dur="3.961">binary field of the actual Json and</text><text start="700.56" dur="3.2">maybe we don&amp;#39;t want it like this so</text><text start="701.92" dur="3.88">let&amp;#39;s fix that all we&amp;#39;d have to do here</text><text start="703.76" dur="3.8">is turn off this response and if we hit</text><text start="705.8" dur="3.92">test step once again it should now be</text><text start="707.56" dur="4.2">coming through as actual text that we</text><text start="709.72" dur="3.72">can access right here rather than binary</text><text start="711.76" dur="3.28">so you have the flexibility if that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="713.44" dur="3.12">how you want to get it back but I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="715.04" dur="4.88">want that in this case and I&amp;#39;m just</text><text start="716.56" dur="6.48">going to change this to get OCR</text><text start="719.92" dur="5.8">results so pin this we have our three</text><text start="723.04" dur="4.52">HTTP requests set up and now we can do</text><text start="725.72" dur="3.6">whatever we want to do with it as far as</text><text start="727.56" dur="4.279">you know do we need to push it into a a</text><text start="729.32" dur="3.92">Google sheet do we need to send an email</text><text start="731.839" dur="3.081">do we need to extract certain text out</text><text start="733.24" dur="4.36">of it so what I would recommend from</text><text start="734.92" dur="5.52">here is that you&amp;#39;re going to use an</text><text start="737.6" dur="5.239">extract information extractor node which</text><text start="740.44" dur="4.639">basically this uses AI to look through</text><text start="742.839" dur="4.68">all of this markdown if you drag it in</text><text start="745.079" dur="4.12">so you would be right here telling it</text><text start="747.519" dur="2.68">you know what text am I looking through</text><text start="749.199" dur="3.161">and then you can set up your different</text><text start="750.199" dur="4">attributes to pull back so let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="752.36" dur="3.52">right now we were just to say you know</text><text start="754.199" dur="5.281">date and change this to a date variable</text><text start="755.88" dur="5.399">type and say the date of the invoice and</text><text start="759.48" dur="4.24">then we could say you know invoice</text><text start="761.279" dur="3.641">number and we could say you know just</text><text start="763.72" dur="3.559">the</text><text start="764.92" dur="5.359">number of the invoice and I know that</text><text start="767.279" dur="4.481">this seems a little bit redundant but</text><text start="770.279" dur="3.041">the idea for this node is that it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="771.76" dur="3.48">always going to be a one toone match of</text><text start="773.32" dur="3.44">like this field has this sometimes</text><text start="775.24" dur="4.12">you&amp;#39;re going to be using this node to</text><text start="776.76" dur="4.4">read through a whole email and then just</text><text start="779.36" dur="3.24">extract a couple key bits of information</text><text start="781.16" dur="3.72">so you&amp;#39;ll give it a description of what</text><text start="782.6" dur="3.64">that looks like like we said it&amp;#39;s an AI</text><text start="784.88" dur="3.28">node so you&amp;#39;re going to have to connect</text><text start="786.24" dur="5.68">some sort of AI model in this case let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="788.16" dur="5.88">just grab a Google Gemini um 20 flash</text><text start="791.92" dur="4.12">let me grab that real quick and then in</text><text start="794.04" dur="4">here the beauty of this is once you run</text><text start="796.04" dur="4.68">it it&amp;#39;s going to Output the different</text><text start="798.04" dur="4.12">information already as a um separate</text><text start="800.72" dur="3.08">Fields so that we could you know if we</text><text start="802.16" dur="4.239">were putting this into Google sheet you</text><text start="803.8" dur="4.76">could easily drag and drop each output</text><text start="806.399" dur="4">field into a specific cell within your</text><text start="808.56" dur="3.719">Google sheet so it makes it really easy</text><text start="810.399" dur="3.24">it splits it all out and keep in mind</text><text start="812.279" dur="2.841">something like an invoice number when</text><text start="813.639" dur="2.921">you&amp;#39;re setting the variable type you may</text><text start="815.12" dur="3.519">think it&amp;#39;s a number but if we were to</text><text start="816.56" dur="3.76">run this it&amp;#39;s going to be wrong because</text><text start="818.639" dur="3.521">the invoice number has an F in it and it</text><text start="820.32" dur="3.44">has a slash and so we don&amp;#39;t get the full</text><text start="822.16" dur="3.119">invoice number so just something to keep</text><text start="823.76" dur="4.199">in mind as you saw when we had this as a</text><text start="825.279" dur="4.321">string it actually came over correctly</text><text start="827.959" dur="4.361">there we go back to a string and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="829.6" dur="5.72">the correct invoice number as you see</text><text start="832.32" dur="3.92">right over here right there there it is</text><text start="835.32" dur="2.56">and so I know I went through
