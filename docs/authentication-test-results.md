This document records the results of testing the authentication system as outlined in the testing plan.

## Test Environment

- Application: YouTube Knowledge Miner
- Date: March 30, 2025
- Browser: Chrome Version 121.0.6167.160 (Official Build)
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Replit)

## 1. Anonymous User Flow

### 1.1 New User Getting an Anonymous Session

**Test Steps Executed:**
1. Cleared all cookies and site data
2. Opened the application
3. Checked browser cookies and network requests

**Results:**
- ✅ Anonymous session cookie created on first page load
- ✅ Network request to `/api/anonymous/videos/count` observed 
- ✅ Session ID follows expected format: `anon_[timestamp]_[random]` (observed: `anon_1743358482445_15d5ylqp`)
- ✅ Console logs show successful session creation

**Console Logs Evidence:**
```
[Anonymous Session] No session found, returning default values
[VideoInput] Fetching video count with session:{}
[Header] Anonymous video count from server: 0
[Anonymous Session] Created new session: anon_1743358482445_15d5ylqp
```

**Network Details:**
- Request: `GET /api/anonymous/videos/count`
- Headers include `x-anonymous-session: anon_1743358482445_15d5ylqp`
- Response: `{ "count": 0, "max_allowed": 3 }`

**Backend Logs:**
```
2025-03-30 18:14:43 info: [app] Anonymous session not found: anon_1743358482445_15d5ylqp
```

**Issues:**
The session is created client-side and sent to the backend, but the backend logs show it doesn't find the session. This might indicate that the session isn't being properly persisted in the database on first creation. However, the client correctly continues to use the same session ID in subsequent requests.
