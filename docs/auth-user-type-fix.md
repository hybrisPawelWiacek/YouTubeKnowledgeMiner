# Authentication User Type Implementation

## Issue

The application needed proper handling of different user types (registered vs. anonymous) to support both authentication modes and enable smooth migration between them.

## Changes Made

1. **Schema Updates**:
   - Added explicit `user_type` field to the users table with values `registered` or `anonymous`
   - Ensured videos table has proper `user_type` tracking
   - Added tracking for anonymous sessions with proper metadata

2. **Registration Flow Updates**:
   - Updated registration process to explicitly set `user_type: 'registered'` for new users
   - Updated anonymous user creation script to set `user_type: 'anonymous'`
   - Applied these changes to both the schema definition and the runtime implementation

3. **Auth Middleware Updates**:
   - Added explicit `user_type` field to anonymous user context in auth middleware
   - Ensured proper detection of registered vs. anonymous sessions

4. **Database Backfill**:
   - Updated existing anonymous user in the database to have the correct `user_type` value
   - Ensured proper association between videos and user types

5. **Migration Service**:
   - Verified that the migration service properly sets the user_type when transferring content from anonymous to registered users
   - Confirmed migration metadata tracking capability for future reference

## Testing Steps

1. Verified that the anonymous user has `user_type: 'anonymous'` in the database
2. Confirmed that new registered users will have `user_type: 'registered'` set automatically
3. Ensured the auth middleware includes user_type information for both user types
4. Verified that the migration service properly handles user type transitions

## Future Improvements

1. Add a database migration script to ensure all users have proper user_type values
2. Add more comprehensive API tests for the authentication flows
3. Enhance the migration service to handle additional content types beyond videos
4. Implement an admin dashboard to view and manage user types
